**Abstract**:
Diverse, accurately labeled 3D human pose data is expensive and studio-bound, while in-the-wild sets lack known
ground truth. We introduce UnrealPose-Gen, an Unreal
Engine 5 pipeline built on Movie Render Queue for highquality offline rendering. Our generated frames include: 
3D joints in world and camera coordinates, (ii) 2D projections and COCO-style keypoints with occlusion and jointvisibility flags, (iii) person bounding boxes, and (iv) camera
intrinsics and extrinsics. We use UnrealPose-Gen to present
UnrealPose-1M, an approximately one million frame corpus comprising eight sequences: five scripted “coherent”
sequences spanning five scenes, approximately 40 actions,
and five subjects; and three randomized sequences across
three scenes, approximately 100 actions, and five subjects,
all captured from diverse camera trajectories for broad
viewpoint coverage. As a fidelity check, we report realto-synthetic results on four tasks: image-to-3D pose, 2D
keypoint detection, 2D-to-3D lifting, and person detection/segmentation. Though time and resources constrain us
from an unlimited dataset, we release the UnrealPose-1M
dataset, as well as the UnrealPose-Gen pipeline to support
3rd-party generation of human pose data.
